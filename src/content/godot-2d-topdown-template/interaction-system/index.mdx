## Features

Interactions with other elements in the level, such as levers, objects, NPCs or transfers, are possible thanks to an Area2D added to the character. The interaction is managed by a `StateInteract` state that offers different configurations, such as:

- The interaction area
- The states to enable on interaction
- The states to enable when leaving the interaction area
- Activate the interaction via the input of an action (defined in _Input Map_)
- Activate the interaction only if all [conditions](#conditions) are met (for example: the character must face a certain direction or an item must be in the inventory)

## Configuration

### Who triggers the Interaction

A character (or any other game element) that initiates an interaction must have:

- An `Area2D` node with the `monitorable` property set to `true`.
- The `collision_layer` property of the `Area2D` must match the `collision_mask` property of an `InteractionArea` defined within a `StateInteract` state.

### The element to Interact with

An element that wants to responds to interactions must meet the following requirements:

- A `StateMachine` with at least one `StateInteract` state enabled.

- The `StateInteract` state must have its `interaction_area` property linked to an `Area2D` node.
- The `Area2D` node must have the `monitoring` property set to `true`.
- The `collision_mask` property of the `Area2D` must match the `collision_layer` property of the areas triggering the interaction.

<Callout type="default">
  An `InteractionArea` node is available to quickly add a pre-configured Area2D,
  ready to be set as an `interaction_area` in a `StateInteract`.
</Callout>

## Conditions

Conditions are a set of rules that must be met to trigger an interaction.
You can add a new condition by adding a new element to the `conditions` list of a `StateInteract` state.

### Pre-Built Conditions

- **CheckDirection**: Ensures the character is facing a specific direction.
- **CheckItems**: Requires the character to have specific items in their inventory.

### Custom Conditions

You can create custom conditions by extending the `Check` class and implementing the `check` method in your script.
The `check` method should return `true` if the condition is met, and `false` otherwise.
You can check the `check_direction.gd` and `check_items.gd` scripts for reference.
