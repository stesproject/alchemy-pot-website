## About Autotiles

Autotiles are a special type of tiles that automatically adapt their appearance based on their placement in the map.
This system makes mapping easier by dynamically adjusting the edges and corners of terrain-like tiles such as water, grass, cliffs, and walls.
Instead of placing multiple tile variations manually, auto tiles blend seamlessly to create natural-looking environments.

### Setting Up Autotiles with TileBitTools

The template includes a handy plugin that allows you to quickly set up **Terrain Sets** for your **Tileset**.
This is especially useful if you want to design levels using **autotiles**.

With the [TileBitTools](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/1757) plugin by [dandeliondino](https://github.com/dandeliondino),
configuring an autotile is quick and easy:

1. Create a new node of type `TileMapLayer`.
   <Image src={_1_add_tilemap_layer} alt="add tilemap layer node" />
2. Select the newly added `TileMapLayer` and create a new `tile_set`.
   <Image src={_2_create_new_tileset} alt="create new tileset" />
3. Click on the newly created Tile Set, expand the **_Terrain Sets_** section, add a new terrain, and then add a new element.
   <Image src={_3_add_new_terrain_set} alt="add new terrain set" />
4. Select the **_TileSet_** tab, add a new **Tile Source** of type **Atlas**, and go to the **_Select_** tab.
   <Image src={_4_tileset_tab} alt="select tileset tab" />
5. In the **_Select_** tab:
   - Select all your tiles.
   - Navigate to the **_TileBitTools_** section (if it doesn't appear automatically, switch tabs and then return to **_Select_**).
   - Expand **_Apply Terrain Template_** and choose the template that matches your tileset.
   - Select the terrain created in step (3) and click **_Apply Changes_**.
     <Image src={_5_apply_terrain_template} alt="apply terrain template" />
6. Now, go to the **_TileMap_** tab, open the **_Terrains_** section, and select the terrain you just created.  
    You can now draw in your `TileMapLayer` using autotiling!

  When creating a new TileSet, make sure to correctly set the `tile_size` value
  according to the dimensions of your tiles.

## Creating a New Level

The template includes a **`Level.tscn`** scene that serves as a starting point for creating all your game levels.

To create a new level:

1. Locate `Level.tscn` in the **FileSystem**.
2. Right-click on it and select **"New Inherited Scene"**.
3. This will create a new scene based on `Level.tscn`, inheriting all its nodes and structure.

### Level Structure

A `Level.tscn` scene is organized as follows:

- **GameCamera2D**: The main game camera, with the `game_camera.gd` script attached, which allows it to follow a specified target.
- **Layers**: Contains all `TileMapLayer` nodes.
- **Props**: Contains the decorative elements and environmental props.
- **Entities**: Contains all level entities, including the player, NPCs, and enemies.
- **Transfers**: Contains level transition nodes. Check the [Scenes Transition](/godot-2d-topdown-template/scenes-transition) page to learn more about **Transfers**.
- **Events**: Contains level-specific events, typically structured using a [State Machine](/godot-2d-topdown-template/state-machines).

These nodes help maintain a structured and organized level layout,
with the exception of **GameCamera2D** and the parent node **Layer**
(which you can name whatever you like to identify your level) and which contains the `level.gd` script, responsible for initializing the player upon entering the level.

### Layers node

The **Layers** node is particularly important as it contains several pre-configured `TileMapLayer` nodes for level design.

The `TileMapLayer` nodes are structured as follows:

- **terrain**: The base ground layer.
- **water**: Used for water or other elements that sit above the base terrain.
- **terrain2**: A secondary terrain layer, useful for elements like shadows or additional details.
- **walls**: Defines walls and solid structures.
- **top**: The highest layer in the hierarchy. This layer always appears above characters, props, and other elements.

<Callout type="info">
  You are free to configure the pre-built layers as needed, starting from
  `Level.tscn`, keeping in mind that in your **inherited levels** you can
  **add** new layers but you **cannot remove** the existing ones.
