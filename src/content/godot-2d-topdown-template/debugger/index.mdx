The debugger is designed to **streamline and accelerate** the testing process for your game. 
It is provided as an **autoload** via the `Debugger` singleton, implemented from the `debugger.gd` script.

## Built-in Debugging Functions

The script includes several **pre-configured debug functions**, each mapped to specific keys for quick access:

- **F1** → Saves the current game by calling `DataManager.save_game()`.
- **F2** → Returns to the **start screen**.
- **CTRL** → Toggles **ghost mode** for all players, allowing them to pass through solid tiles.
- **TAB** → Toggles **screen view**, hiding or showing all players and their HP bars.
- **0** → Resets the player's **velocity**.
- **3** → Restores all players' **health**.
- **5** → Stops all **enemies**.

## Customizing the Debugger

You can **extend** or **modify** the `debugger.gd` script to include additional debugging functions tailored to your needs.

For instance, if you want the **TAB key** to only toggle the visibility of HP bars instead of hiding the players' sprites, you can modify the `_toggle_screen_view()` function like this:

```gdscript
func _toggle_screen_view():
    for player: PlayerEntity in Globals.get_players():
        # player.visible = !player.visible  # (Commented out to keep the player visible)
        player.health_controller.hp_bar.visible = !player.health_controller.hp_bar.visible
```

## Adding Your Own Debug Functions

To add **custom debugging features**, simply define a new function inside `debugger.gd` and bind it to a key within the `_unhandled_key_input(event)` function.

For example, to **remove an item from the player**, you can add the following function:

```gdscript
func _remove_player_item():
    var player = Globals.get_players()[0]
    if player:
        player.inventory.remove_item("key", 1)
```

Then, bind it to a key in `_unhandled_key_input(event)`:

```gdscript
if event is InputEventKey and event.pressed:
  match event.keycode:
    KEY_4:
      _remove_player_item()
```

The `debugger.gd` script is **simple yet powerful**, providing essential testing utilities while being fully customizable. 
Explore it, tweak it, and expand it to suit your development workflow!
