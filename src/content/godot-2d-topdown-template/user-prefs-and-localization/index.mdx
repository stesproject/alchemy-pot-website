## User Preferences

Unlike the [Save/Load System](/godot-2d-topdown-template/save-load-system), which handles game data related to the game loop, **User Preferences (UserPrefs)** are used to store global settings unrelated to gameplay. These are ideal for saving user settings such as **music volume, sound effects volume, selected language**, or any other preferences you want to include.

In the template, saving and loading user preferences is managed by the `user_prefs.gd` script. Preferences are **automatically loaded** when opening the `settings_menu.tscn` scene, handled by `settings_menu.gd`, and **automatically saved** when exiting the scene.

### Available User Preferences

In the `SettingsMenu` scene, the following preferences are available by default:

- **Music Volume**
- **SFX Volume**
- **Language**

You can extend this system by adding new preferences in your game and managing their values as demonstrated in `settings_menu.gd`.

### How to Save and Load User Preferences

1. **Load or Create User Preferences**  
   First, create or load a `UserPrefs` instance using:

   ```gdscript
   user_prefs = UserPrefs.load_or_create()
   ```

2. **Modify Preferences**  
   When a setting is changed, update the corresponding value in `user_prefs`:

   ```gdscript
   user_prefs.language = lang
   ```

3. **Save the Preferences**  
   Finally, save the preferences to a file using:

   ```gdscript
   user_prefs.save()
   ```

## Localization

To make your game accessible in different languages, **Godot's built-in localization system** is used. You can find the full documentation [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/i18n/internationalizing_games.html).

### Setting Up Translations

Localization is handled via a **CSV translation file**, where each column corresponds to a language. You can refer to the `translations.csv` file included in the template as an example.

Make sure to import your CSV file as **CSV Translation** in Godot. It's recommended to set the `delimiter` to **Semicolon (;)**, especially if you plan to use the same file for dialogue translations.

For **Control nodes**, translation is handled automatically as long as `auto_translate_mode` is not set to _Disabled_.

For **dialogues** managed by the [Dialogue System](/godot-2d-topdown-template/dialogue-system), refer to the [Godot Dialogue Manager documentation on translations](https://github.com/nathanhoad/godot_dialogue_manager/blob/main/docs/Translations.md).

### Adding or Removing Languages

To modify the available languages, update the `LANGUAGES` array in `Const.gd`. Languages listed here will appear in the **Language** dropdown in the `SettingsMenu` scene.

<Callout type="warning">
  Ensure that each language in the `LANGUAGES` array has a corresponding column
  in the **CSV Translation** file.
</Callout>
