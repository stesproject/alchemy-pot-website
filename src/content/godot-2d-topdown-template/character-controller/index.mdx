## What is a Character

Characters in your game are dynamic entities capable of moving and performing various actions within a level. By using a [StateMachine](/godot-2d-topdown-template/state-machines) node, you can configure and manage different states to control their behavior seamlessly.

State scripts interact with functions defined in the `CharacterEntity` class (or any script that extends from it).
The pre-built system allows your characters to:

- Move
  <Video src={char_walk} class="my-0 object-none" width="100" height="100" />
- Run
  <Video src={char_run} class="my-0 object-none" width="100" height="100" />
- Jump
  <Video src={char_jump} class="my-0 object-none" width="100" height="100" />
- Attack
  <Video src={char_attack} class="my-0 object-none" width="100" height="100" />
- Flash (for example, when receiving damage)
  <Video src={char_flash} class="my-0 object-none" width="100" height="100" />
- Interact with other game elements and entities
  <Video
    src={char_interact}
    class="my-0 object-none"
    width="100"
    height="100"
  />

These capabilities can be further expanded by adding new functions to the character's script and customizing the states defined in the character's StateMachine.

Additionally, you can integrate a HealthController node to manage a character's health points, making it easy to handle damage, healing, or showing a custom health bar.

## Pre-built Characters

The template includes two pre-built characters: a **player** (`player.tscn`) and an **enemy** (`enemy.tscn`).
Both characters share the same base script, `character_entity.gd`. The difference lies in their implementation:

- The player extends the `CharacterEntity` class through the `player_entity.gd` script.
- The enemy uses the `character_entity.gd` script directly.

You're free to create a custom `enemy_entity.gd` script that extends from `CharacterEntity` to add specific functionality for enemies that are not present in the base class.

### Player

What makes the player character unique is the ability to respond to user inputs.
This functionality is managed by a specialized state called `StateInputListener`.
By adding this state to any character, you can make it responsive to inputs, not just the player.
The actions that `StateInputListener` listens for are defined in _Project Settings > Input Map_.
You can customize the controls to fit your needs.
Furthermore, the player character includes:

- a `StateMachine` node with pre-built states to handle movement, attack, hurt, fall, and death.
- a `InteractionTrigger` node to [detect interactions](/godot-2d-topdown-template/interaction-system) with other game elements.
- a `SmokeParticles` node for visual effects when the character runs.
- an `Inventory` node for managing items.
- a `HealthController` node to manage health points.

### Enemy

The enemy character is a simplified version of the player character.
It includes a `StateMachine` node to handle death.
The enemy character also includes a `HealthController` node to manage health points.

## Create a New Character

To create new characters, simply create a new scene inheriting from the `entity.tscn `scene.

<Image src={new_inherited_scene} alt="Inheriting from the entity.tscn scene" />
This scene serves as the foundation for all characters, including the pre-built
ones in the template. Features of the `entity.tscn` scene include:

- Pre-Built animations: idle, walk, run, jump, and attack animations managed by an `AnimationPlayer` node and an `AnimationTree`.
- Dynamic shadow: a `Shadow` node that adjusts its size dynamically based on the character's height (e.g., when the character jumps).
- Flash shader: a shader applied to the AnimatedSprite2D node that creates a flash effect, useful for visual feedback (e.g., when the character takes damage).
- Collision detection:
  - the `BlocksDetector` node detects collisions with walls and obstacles.
  - the `FallDetector` node identifies when the character has jumped into a non-walkable area.
- Combat features:
  - the `HitBox` node detects collisions with enemies.
  - the `HurtBox` node detects collisions with enemy hitboxes.

<Callout type="default">
  For more specialized characters, you can also inherit from the `player.tscn`
  or `enemy.tscn` scenes.
</Callout>

## Character Actions

The `CharacterEntity` class includes several functions that you can call to perform actions on the character.

### Move

The `move()` function moves the character in a given direction.
This function is used by the `StateInputListener` state to move the player character based on user inputs and also by other states to move the character in a specific direction.
When the character moves, the `facing` property is updated to reflect the direction of movement and the `is_moving` property is set to `true`.

### Run

To make the character run, you just need to pass a value higher than 1 to the property `speed_multiplier`.
This value is used to multiply the character's speed when moving.
In the `StateInputListener` state the `speed_multiplier` property is updated to make the character run when the `run` action is pressed.
When the character runs, the `is_running` property is set to `true` and the `running_particles`, if present, are activated.

### Jump

The `jump()` function makes the character jump.
In the `StateInputListener` state the `jump()` function is called when the `jump` action is pressed.
In the `jump()` function, the `is_jumping` property is set to `true` and other properties are updated to manage the jump.
At the end of the jump, you have to call the `end_jump()` function to reset the character's properties. Ideally this function should be called when the character lands on the ground.
In a `CharacterEntity` this is handled by the `jump` animation of the `AnimationPlayer`.

### Attack

The `attack()` function makes the character attack.
In the `StateInputListener` state the `attack()` function is called when the `attack` action is pressed.
In the `PlayerEntity`, the value of the `is_attacking` is handled by the `attack` state of the `StateMachine` with a `StateParamsSetter` state.
At the end of the attack, you have to call the `end_attack()` function to reset the character's properties. Ideally this function should be called when the attack animation ends.
In a `CharacterEntity` this is handled by the `char-attack/` animations of the `AnimationPlayer`.

### Flash

The `flash()` function makes the character sprites flash.
To make the sprites flash:

- The sprites must have a shader material with the `flash.gdshader` shader.
- The sprites must be in the `flash` group.

### Interact

To enable interactions, a character requires the following:

- An `Area2D` node with the `monitorable` property set to `true`.
- The `collision_layer` property of the `Area2D` must match the `collision_mask` property of an `InteractionArea` defined within a `StateInteract` state.

Check the [Interaction System](/godot-2d-topdown-template/interaction-system) for more details.

## Health Controller

The _HealthController_ is a versatile node that can be added to any character or entity (or node) to manage its health points (HP).
It keeps track of the current HP value and provides a simple way to handle health-related events.
If you want to display a visual representation of the entity's health, you can assign a scene to the `health_bar` property, which will automatically update based on the current HP.

The behavior of the Health Controller can be customized using states from the [StateMachine](/godot-2d-topdown-template/state-machines).
You can define what happens when HP increases, decreases, or reaches zero.
This makes it easy to trigger effects such as damage animations, healing effects, or death sequences.

By default, both the `player.tscn` and `enemy.tscn` scenes include a _HealthController_ node, allowing you to easily manage their health status.
If needed, you can extend this system by adding a Health Controller to other entities and customizing how they react to HP changes.

### Health Bars

A **Health Bar** provides a visual representation of an entity's health, making it easier for players to track damage and healing.
To display a health bar for any character or entity, assign a scene to the `health_bar` property of the _HealthController_.
This allows the health bar to automatically update whenever HP changes.

For an example of how to set up a health bar, check the pre-built `player_hud.tscn` scene.
This scene demonstrates how to properly configure a health bar to follow an entity and visually represent its health status.
You can use it as a reference to create custom health bars for enemies, NPCs, or other game elements.
