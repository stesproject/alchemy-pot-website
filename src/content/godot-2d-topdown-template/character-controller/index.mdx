## What is a Character

Characters in your game are dynamic entities capable of moving and performing various actions within a level. By using a [StateMachine](/godot-2d-topdown-template/state-machines) node, you can configure and manage different states to control their behavior seamlessly.

State scripts interact with functions defined in the `CharacterEntity` class (or any script that extends from it).
The pre-built system allows your characters to:

- Move
  <Video src={char_walk} class="my-0 object-none" width="100" height="100" />
- Run
  <Video src={char_run} class="my-0 object-none" width="100" height="100" />
- Jump
  <Video src={char_jump} class="my-0 object-none" width="100" height="100" />
- Attack
  <Video src={char_attack} class="my-0 object-none" width="100" height="100" />
- Flash (for example, when receiving damage)
  <Video src={char_flash} class="my-0 object-none" width="100" height="100" />
- Interact with other game elements and entities
  <Video
    src={char_interact}
    class="my-0 object-none"
    width="100"
    height="100"
  />

These capabilities can be further expanded by adding new functions to the character's script and customizing the states defined in the character's StateMachine.

Additionally, you can integrate a HealthController node to manage a character's health points, making it easy to handle damage, healing, or showing a custom health bar.

## Pre-built Characters

The template includes two pre-built characters: a **player** (`player.tscn`) and an **enemy** (`enemy.tscn`).
Both characters share the same base script, `character_entity.gd`. The difference lies in their implementation:

- The player extends the `CharacterEntity` class through the `player_entity.gd` script.
- The enemy uses the `character_entity.gd` script directly.

You're free to create a custom `enemy_entity.gd` script that extends from `CharacterEntity` to add specific functionality for enemies that are not present in the base class.

### Player

What makes the player character unique is the ability to respond to user inputs.
This functionality is managed by a specialized state called `StateInputListener`.
By adding this state to any character, you can make it responsive to inputs, not just the player.
The actions that `StateInputListener` listens for are defined in _Project Settings > Input Map_.
You can customize the controls to fit your needs.

### Create a New Character

To create new characters, simply create a new scene inheriting from the `entity.tscn `scene.

<Image
  src={new_inherited_scene}
  alt="Inheriting from the entity.tscn scene"
  class="mx-auto" />
This scene serves as the foundation for all characters, including the pre-built ones in the template.
Features of the `entity.tscn` scene include:

- Pre-Built animations: idle, walk, run, jump, and attack animations managed by an `AnimationPlayer` node and an `AnimationTree`.
- Dynamic shadow: a `Shadow` node that adjusts its size dynamically based on the character's height (e.g., when the character jumps).
- Flash shader: a shader applied to the AnimatedSprite2D node that creates a flash effect, useful for visual feedback (e.g., when the character takes damage).
- Collision detection:
  - the `BlocksDetector` node detects collisions with walls and obstacles.
  - the `FallDetector` node identifies when the character has jumped into a non-walkable area.
- Combat features:
  - the `HitBox` node detects collisions with enemies.
  - the `HurtBox` node detects collisions with enemy hitboxes.

For more specialized characters, you can also inherit from the `player.tscn` or `enemy.tscn` scenes:

- `player.tscn`:
  - Includes a `SmokeParticles` node for visual effects when the character runs.
  - Includes a `StateMachine` node with pre-built states to handle movement, attack, hurt, fall and death.
  - Features an `Inventory` node for managing items.
  - Includes a `HealthController` node to manage health points.

- `enemy.tscn`:
  - Simplified compared to the player scene but still customizable for unique enemy behaviors.
  - Also includes a `HealthController` node.

Try inheriting from these scenes to create and customize characters to suit your game's specific needs.
