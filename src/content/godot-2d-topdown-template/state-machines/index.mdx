## Intro

A State Machine allows you to manage different states for any game element.
Examples include:

- A chest: initially closed and interactable. When the player interacts with it, it opens.
  The chest has two states: _closed_ and _opened_.

- An enemy: patrols an area initially. When the player enters its detection area, it begins to follow the player.
  The enemy has two states: _patrolling_ and _following_.

- The player: initially alive and controlled via inputs. When health reaches 0, the player dies and can no longer move.
  The player has two states: _alive_ and _dead_.

Each state defines a specific behavior for an entity. States are implemented as scripts that inherit from the `State` class, enabling them to be managed by a State Machine.

## The StateMachine Class

The `StateMachine` class is responsible for grouping multiple states (as child nodes) and managing their lifecycle.
While a single State Machine is typically sufficient, you can add as many State Machines as needed under any node. Each State Machine independently handles the activation, deactivation, and processing of a single state.

## Adding States

Once you have added a `StateMachine` to a node, you need to add one or more states under it to start managing the node's behavior.
To add a state:

1. Add the desired state scripts as children of the State Machine.
2. Assign the initial state to the current_state property of the State Machine.

The State Machine automatically manages the rest, including state transitions and processing.

<Callout type="default">
  A state can contain multiple nested states. When the parent state is
  activated, all its nested states are automatically activated and processed
  alongside it. When the parent state is deactivated, all nested states are also
  disabled.
</Callout>

## State Lifecycle

Each state has specific lifecycle functions that define its behavior:

### enter()

Defines what happens when the state is activated.

### exit()

Defines what happens when the state is deactivated.

### update()

Defines what happens during each process frame while the state is active.

### physics_update()

Defines what happens during each physics process frame while the state is active.

## Changing States

To transition between states you can:

1. Call the `enable()` function on the desired state:
   this will activate the state and deactivate the current state.
   This is useful when a state needs to be activated immediately.

2. Call the `complete()` function of the current state:
   this will mark the state as "completed", meaning it will activate the states defined
   in its `on_completion` array.
   This is useful when a state needs to perform some actions before transitioning to another state
   and can be considered "completed" when those actions are done.
   For example, a dialogue state can be considered "completed" when the dialogue ends.

3. Set a timer:
   set the `time_range` property of the state.
   The current state will transition to the `on_completion` states when the timer expires.
   This is useful when a state have to be activated after a certain amount of time.
   For example, the enemy can follow the player for a limited time before returning to the patrol state.

<Callout type="warning">
  Under the same State Machine, when a new state is activated the current state
  is always automatically disabled.
</Callout>

## Pre-built States

The template includes several pre-built states that you can use out of the box:

- **StateAnimation**: starts an animation defined in an `AnimationPlayer` or `AnimationTree`.
- **StateCallable**: invokes a method from another node.
- **StateDebug**: prints a message in the terminal for debugging purposes.
- **StateDialogue**: starts a dialogue defined using the [Dialogue System](/godot-2d-topdown-template/dialogue-system).
- **StateInteract**: manages interactions using the [Interaction System](/godot-2d-topdown-template/interaction-system).
- **StateMaterial**: changes the material of a Sprite2D node.
- **StateParamsSetter**: sets properties of a node upon entering and/or exiting the state.
- **StateTween**: defines and calls a tween on a node.
- **StateEntity**: the base state from which all specific entity states extend.

The states that extend `StateEntity` are:

- **StateFollow**: makes the entity follow a target (without using `NavigationAgent2D`).
- **StateIdle**: stops the entity and possibly disables it.
- **StateImpulse**: applies an impulse to the entity.
- **StateInputListener**: handles inputs to move and control the entity (eg: the player).
- **StateNavigation**: makes the entity follow a target using a `NavigationAgent2D` (useful for avoiding obstacles).
- **StatePath**: makes the entity follow a path defined in a `Path2D`.
- **StateWander**: makes the entity wander around randomly.

<Callout type="default">
  You can always create new states by extending the base scripts `state.gd` or
  `state_entity.gd`.
</Callout>

## Listening for State Changes

The `ChangeStateListener` node allows you to listen for state changes in another node's State Machine.
For each listening state, you can associate a state to enable.
This functionality is useful for managing interactions between different game elements.
For example, a door can listen to the states of a lever and open or close based on the lever's state.
