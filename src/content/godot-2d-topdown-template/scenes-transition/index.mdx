Smooth transitions between scenes, such as moving from the title screen to the first level or switching between game levels, enhance the player experience.
This process is handled by the `SceneManager` autoload from the [Godot4 Game Template](https://github.com/baconandgames/godot4-game-template) by [baconandgames](https://github.com/baconandgames).

## Loading a Scene

To load a scene with a transition effect, simply call the `swap_scenes` function as follows:

```gdscript
SceneManager.swap_scenes(scene_to_load: String, load_into: Node, scene_to_unload: Node, transition_type: String)
```

The `swap_scenes` function takes the following arguments:

- **`scene_to_load`**: The file path of the scene to load.
- **`load_into`**: The parent node where the new scene will be loaded.
- **`scene_to_unload`**: Usually the current scene that needs to be removed.
- **`transition_type`**: The type of transition effect to use.

### Transition Types

The `SceneManager` includes several built-in transition effects by default:

- `fade_to_black`
- `fade_from_black`
- `fade_to_white`
- `fade_from_white`
- `no_from_transition`
- `no_to_transition`
- `wipe_from_right`
- `wipe_to_right`

You're free to create and add your own transition effects. To do this:

1. Open the `loading_canvass.tscn` scene.
2. Add a new animation to the `AnimationPlayer` node.
3. Use the name of the new animation as the `transition_type` parameter when calling `swap_scenes`.

<Callout type="info">
  If loading a scene takes too long, the `SceneManager` will automatically
  display a loading bar. You can customize this loading bar by modifying the
  `loading_canvass.tscn` scene.

## Transfers

The template includes a pre-built scene, **`transfer.tscn`**, designed to handle automatic transitions between levels.

To integrate it into a level:

1. **Add the `transfer.tscn` scene** to your level.
2. **Position it** where you want the transfer to occur.
3. **Configure the parameters** exposed by the `transfer.gd` script.

<Image src={add_transfer} alt="add transfer scene" />

By default, the level transition is triggered when the player enters the designated **`InteractionArea`**.
This interaction is managed by the **`StateInteract`** state of a [StateMachine](/godot-2d-topdown-template/state-machines).

Each `Transfer` instance can be customized to fit your level's needs.
To modify an individual `Transfer`:

1. **Right-click** on the `Transfer` node in the scene hierarchy.
2. Select **_Editable Children_** to access and adjust its properties.

<Image
  src={transfer_editable_children}
  alt="allow editable children in transfer"
/>

This allows you to define custom conditions for triggering the level transition.

<Callout type="warning">
  To maintain a well-organized level, it's recommended to place all Transfers
  under the designated *Transfers* node in your level hierarchy.
