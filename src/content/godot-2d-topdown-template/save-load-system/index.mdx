## Game Data Management

The template includes a simple yet powerful data management system that manages saving and loading operations for nodes that require data persistence.
This functionality is orchestrated by the `DataManager` singleton.

The system already processes data for `StateMachine`, `CharacterEntity`, and `PlayerEntity` classes, covering most common use cases.
You can extend it to any additional class, as described below.

### Data Handling Functions

Nodes requiring data persistence must:

- Belong to the `save` group
- Implement these functions:
  - `get_data`: Defines what data to save.
  - `receive_data`: Processes loaded data.

The `DataManager` singleton handles all the rest.

The classes that already have the `get_data` and `receive_data` functions implemented will process these data:

- **StateMachine**:

  - The index of the current state.

- **CharacterEntity**:

  - Position
  - Facing direction

- **PlayerEntity**:
  - Position
  - Facing direction
  - Current HP
  - Max HP
  - Inventory
  - Equipped weapon ID

Modify the `get_data` and `receive_data` functions to customize the data being saved and loaded.  
You can assign the `save` group and implement these functions in any script to define exactly what data should be stored and retrieved.

### Save Data

| Function          | Description                                                                                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `save_game`       | Saves the current game data to the file path defined in `Const.SAVE_FILE_BASE_PATH`.                                  |
| `save_level_data` | Stores the data of all nodes in the `save` group present in the current level that implement the `get_data` function. |

<Callout type="info">
  The `save_level_data` function is called automatically by any `Transfer` node
  when leaving the current level.
</Callout>

A typical workflow will call `save_level_data` first and `save_game` a later time to save the game data to a file.

<Callout type="warning">
  Game data will be lost if the game is closed without calling the `save_game`
  function.
</Callout>

### Load Data

| Function          | Description                                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `load_game`       | Restores the full game data from the file path defined in `Const.SAVE_FILE_BASE_PATH`.                                     |
| `load_level_data` | Updates the data of all nodes in the `save` group present in the current level that implement the `receive_data` function. |

<Callout type="info">
  The `load_level_data` function is called automatically by any `Level` node
  when entering a level.
</Callout>

A typical workflow will call `load_game` first and `load_level_data` a later time to load the level data from a file.

## Summary

- Add nodes to the `save` group for data persistence and implement `get_data` and `receive_data` functions to handle the data.
- The `DataManager` singleton handles the saving and loading operations, you just need to call the appropriate functions.
- The data management system ensures that saved data persists between levels and across game sessions.

<Callout type="info">
  You decide when to call the save and load functions based on the requirements
  of your game.
